    'Investigation on First Nation built environment and dwellings in the Eastern Cape, South Africa',
    'With this ongoing community-led project, the working group (First Indigenous Peoples-Nelson Mandela University staff and students) is documenting, studying, and moving awareness of the First Indigenous Peoples of South Africa’s settlements and dwellings (self-built with local materials) located in a remote area of the Eastern Cape, and never studied before. A unique example of a regenerative approach to the built environment where the Indigenous building knowledge, typology, technique and materials (Indigenous Knowledge System) have been handed down from generation to generation, from pre-colonial times till the present, orally, despite the long history of repression and segregation, the Indigenous Peoples went through since the arrival of the settler colonialists. The working group was formed in 2015, under the umbrella of the Nelson Mandela University School of Architecture, and led by Dr Magda Minguzzi. Since then, their focus is on community engagement projects, based on practice research, that involve teaching, learning and research. In the current environmental-socio-economic crisis that we are facing, globally, these First Nations dwellings under study and the IKS applied to represent a unique example of equal opportunity to housing, which empowers people (self-building), improves their living conditions and creates food security lifestyle. It is urgent to open a global to re-activate our forgotten indigenous knowledge, rooted in a regenerative approach to the built environment and resources.

    'AWF Primary Schools in Karamoja',
    'Two primary schools on an area of 2000 sqm located in immediate adjacency to Kidepo Valley National Park in Karamoja/ North-eastern Uganda. One school built in the park buffer zone and another in a farming village nearby, both with the ambition to multiply their influence among each of their 750 school children, their immediate families, and their surrounding communities.

In total, 21 buildings across 2 schools, each with 9 classrooms reinforce the vision of AWF to integrate stunning landscapes within the schools, create beautiful that are friendly to the environment on which they are placed and elevate the perceptions of indigenous materials. Due to the remoteness of the sites and the associated high transport costs, building materials were carefully selected to be sourced locally and built with local labour wherever possible. The Kidepo area has beautiful local stone which was utilised for near-carbon-neutral foundations and plinth walls. The stones were gathered by the locals within a 3km radius of the site and arranged in semi-dry-stack formations creating a water-mitigating substructure. Walling utilises fair-faced, manually compressed stabilized soil blocks (CEBs) formed on site, a material that presents a much more ecological alternative to the commonly used “village brick” which is a main cause of deforestation in Uganda. 
The steel roof trusses were designed using very thin steel profiles, of the size more commonly used for windows and doors; the idea was to optimise the design so much that the entire primary roof structure of two schools would fit into a single truck. The idea was not only to minimise transport costs but also to reduce the weight of each truss to such an extent that they can be hoisted in place by muscle power. Sliding and top-hung steel louvre panels form windows and doors, multicoloured as inspired by the local jewelry design, provide a sturdy, maintenance-efficient response to shading and security requirements.',

The main exhibition hall is located in the agriculture exhibition area, north of Chengxin Pu Expressway and west of the Yangma River, with a land area of about 135,000 square meters. It includes the functions of agricultural exhibition hall, conference center, Tianfu Agricultural Civilization Museum, cultural and creative incubation, characteristic commercial neighborhood, outdoor exhibition space and other functions, with a total construction area of about 132,000 square meters. The project uses five arched scaffolding to interpenetrate with the surrounding pastoral landscape, and adopts prefabricated steel and wood structure scaffolding combined with colorful ETFE enclosure system to create a semi-outdoor non-energy consumption space, embodies the concept of green development and environmentally friendly design. Ecological energy-saving. 
The plan adopts a finger-shaped penetration layout pattern, which is mutually infiltrated with the pastoral landscape. At the same time, in order to reflect the characteristics of the agricultural expo exhibition and take into account the basic needs of wind and rain shelter, it mainly adopts the form of an outdoor exhibition venue with a roof. Through appropriate passive green building technology, the organization of air flow is guided to create a comfortable semi-outdoor activity space. The exhibition part has achieved the goal of near-zero energy consumption, truly realizing the green ecological concept that is in line with the agricultural expo. The design of the building opening effectively organizes the air flow to form a ventilation corridor, so that the indoor temperature can be kept in a more comfortable state for a long time. The microclimate environment of human activities has been greatly improved. In addition, fog spraying additional measures are used at a close range to regulate the micro-environment.
Wooden frame. 
The architectural form is a large-span structure, combined with the fact that the project is located in farmland, abandoning the reinforced concrete structure form that causes greater damage to farmland during construction and is not renewable. Laminated wood structure is a negative carbon material that can be carbon-fixed. It can better reflect ecological and agricultural characteristics and is all factory-processed. On-site assembly reduces construction errors and ensures completion quality. At the same time, wooden structures originate from nature, with simple colors and in line with agricultural expo characteristics.
Colorful film. 
ETFE film material is light in weight, good in light transmission, easy to color, and can be matched with colorful fields through colorful textures to better reflect agricultural expo concepts.
Implanted nature.

    'Future Edu Space(FES) Prototype',
    'The Future Edu Space (FES) classroom has been envisaged to promote and inspire the creation of creative, sustainable, and comfortable educational spaces. It has been designed to transform learning experiences, considering many Chilean schools in the Bio-Bío region have deficient infrastructure that critically affects the student community. 

FES used an interdisciplinary approach, linking areas as diverse as architecture, design, education, and engineering. Public and private entities contributed to specific solutions, with the region’s key actors involved In a highly participative process. Teachers, principals, and school boards took part, giving their vision for future classrooms. Psychologists, educators, and specialists in pedagogical innovation provided guidelines about how the space had to foster 21st-century skills. The resulting space acts as a mediator between teaching practices and student learning, with the potential to develop creative and innovative skills while stimulating active participation, interaction, and communication. 

This prototype has a demonstrational role for the region’s architecture and design offices, wood companies, and builders about schools and technology transfer. It is a result of the project, “Future Edu Space: Generation of Technological Capacities to Build State-of-the-art Sustainable Educational Space from the Biobío Region”, an initiative financed by the Bio-Bío Regional Government’s Innovation for Competitivity Fund (FIC-R). The Future Edu Space (FES) prototype is an educational space that combines flexibility, adaptability, and variety in its use. Its design was developed based on interdisciplinary and collaborative work involving actors from education, design, architecture, construction, and wood industrialization. The BIM method was used throughout the design process, combined with virtual reality tools.

To break with the traditional classroom layout, it has been designed using a square neutral-style floor plan, which allows using the classroom in different senses and creating multiple educational scenarios. It has a total surface area of 100m2, with a central area of 70m2 for 35 students.

Its structure comprises two active sidewalls to support the pedagogical activities. One holds furniture for individual learning activities, and the other, which can also store furniture, has a large interactive board. It also has an acoustic wall that folds inward to extend activities to an adjoining space. The final wall is glazed, connecting with the outside to take pedagogical activities further still.
Passive strategies are included to generate appropriate environmental conditions: temperature (thermal envelope), air quality (crossed ventilation), acoustics (foldable acoustic doors and partition), and daylight (lucarnes and view windows).

It considers the design of flexible furniture to provide an easily adjusted multipurpose learning space. For example, changing from a presentation space to one for participation or group work.

FES is designed with a wooden prefabricated system, to foster wood-based architecture in the education area. The geometry is obtained from a construction technology capacity and modulation process. A 1.2m x 3m CLT (Cross Laminated Timber) module, which is easy to transport and meets the requirements of the architectural space, is used for the sidewalls using the manufacturing skills of local wood companies.

The educational space’s structure comprises CLT frames that form part of the active sidewalls, with GLT (Glued Laminated Timber) beams for the ceiling’s caisson structure. CLT wall braces are placed between the frames. The walls do not have an indoor coating, leaving the same CLT pine wall. The outdoor covering is a thermally modified tongue and groove.

The FES prototype is conceived as a unitary system that can be repeated and joined together to generate new options. Three variants are proposed: EDU SPACE FRONT, EDU SPACE NEXT, and EDU SPACE UP. These are organized by two main elements: the essential indoor space module, and an independent ring surrounding it, forming an intermediate space. The prototype and its variants inspire projecting and building new ways of developing school architecture.',

The planning provides ample space for one of the most essential needs of a school—the playground, tucked on one side of the site.
 
The overall site of 305sq. m. offers a classroom equipped with storage shelves for books and educational toys, a staff room for the teachers, designed with storage units for examination papers and academic journals, and lastly, multi-purpose hall which doubles up as an additional classroom or a dining hall if and when need be.
 
In the foresight, an additional floor can be added by dismantling the vaulted roof temporarily for construction. The same can be assembled as a roof for the next level and the central gutter beam can unfold to extend the slab floor. Even with these changes the dynamics will only be affected positively.
 
All the current spaces are carefully designed in the 102 sq. m. built-up area the premise offers. The classroom’s orientation responds evidently to the breeze pattern and sun path. Considering the soil conditions present, a pile foundation is constructed to strengthen the substructure on which the load-bearing brick walls find their ground. The process is furthered with the vaulted metal sheet roof that minimizes the heavy structural cost and makes the form structurally rigid with minimal support.
 
As one looks deeper into the shape of the structure and the design of the classrooms, the semi-circular volumes serve as noise buffers to the disturbances caused by vehicles passing by on the adjacent side of the road.
 
A free path for ventilation and light is created by the high ceilings, which on the outer side are made up of non-reflective roofing material to reduce heat gain.
 
Each and every wall is painted with pieces of information the child will imbibe even while sitting idly; one of the prominent being a depiction of The Big Dipper on the classroom’s low-height ceilings which is a craft intervention made by inserting an acrylic rod within the slab.
 
Yellow glossy coloured epoxy flooring added additional layer of fun and are painted with mathematical learnings and traditional floor games to utilise the flooring area at its best. Moreover, the playground, just like the classroom, is a product of psychologically backed design thinking, subtly introducing the concept of an amphitheatre to its tiny users. The steps under the overhang double up as seats for when the school is to conduct a recreational activity that requires staging and audience areas. The superstructure revolves around local bricks & traditional pattern as infill materials to bridge the gap between technicalities and rooted aesthetics.',

This is the vision shared by our patron, an artist  Rajshri Deshpande. She is also the founder of  Nabhangan  foundation.
 
The design conceived as Knowledge pod. A place to learn, contemplate & play all around.
Pod has potential to form communal space, where villagers with diverse age can gather, accomplish  the reading habit and also a perfect setting  for storytellers  too.
 
A deliberate attempt to insert  the library pod within the existing rural school & our intent is to shape it as part of the school &  surrounding.
Pod amidst existing rain tree, pipal  tree and also encircled by graffiti art works created by local artist & students. It creates the colourful and shaded foreground.
 
This inserted library pod serves as the two parallel worlds, A one being introverted book shelf  & other as vibrant scribble or black board.
Book shelf positioned to create intimate seating possibilities with existing steps around and rubber wood bench as part of the pod. The large overhang serves the purpose for seating area.
 
Black board oriented  towards larger shaded open space, Creates the place under shade to serve as outdoor classroom.
A backdrop for early morning gatherings & lunch time play activities.
 
Library pod Insert  accomplishes the multifaceted activities for students and villagers. As we trace back our academic culture to the gurukul system while evolving into a society that focuses on technology in education, the Indian demographical context cannot be ignored. The quest for knowledge doesn’t know restrictions, it is where the willingness is— across age groups and interests, and it has to be addressed at the grassroots level in order to excel collectively. What better way to address it than to start from the villages of India, where natural inquisitiveness thrives, despite proper infrastructure and resources.
 
“When there are bus stops in each village, there should be a library stop too.”
 
 This was the thought behind Rajshri Deshpande’s initiation for Library Pod—an arena for knowledge that has the potential to form a communal space where villagers of diverse ages can gather, and accomplish the reading habit and also a perfect setting for storytellers too. The crux of the project lies in its location—it is a deliberate architectural intervention that utilizes only 17.16 sqm of space in a rural school that has an area of 220 sqm. The pod is built where knowledge resides—a school in the village of Aurangabad, Maharashtra. It takes up a lot less space as compared to the impact it puts on the virtue of education. The structure is strategically built under a peepal tree, in a space encircled by graffiti artworks created by local artists & students. It consists of a storage shelf and a projecting metal roof designed to shield the users from extreme weather conditions, made up of thin steel plate rafters and purlin that taper towards the edges to express the lightness against the visually heavy bookshelf. The entire unit in metal doubles up as water-tight bookshelves and as blackboards on the other side, which cater to the outdoors, making it suitable to conduct a class under the peepal tree as well.  Since it is outside the built school structure and open to sky, the bookshelves had to be made water and dust-free by using rubber gaskets to seal them and GI sheets to make up their framework and shutters. The bookshelves were made by the manufacturers of streetside electrical distribution board boxes, who have prefabricated the unit and assembled it at the location to maintain workmanship and quality. An extension of this unit is made by adding a rubber wooden bench beside it. The flooring for this pod is constructed with bricks, in a way that they start from level zero and up to the pod’s level by creating small steps in between, also serving as a place to sit. The brick base is covered by the overhang which is supported by 80mm*80mm M.S. box sections as columns. The pod also serves as a backdrop for early morning gatherings and lunchtime play activities in the school while successfully accomplishing multifaceted activities for students and villagers alike. With that being stated, the Libray Pod is an example of how the biggest of achievements start with the smallest of inventions.
 
The pinnacle of mankind can be understood by the way inventions are made. It is in the bigger achievements that the technological advancements are measured, however, the smallest of interventions making the biggest of differences are worth paying attention to. Completed in December 2021, the Library Pod is a successful initiative by Nabhangan Foundation, which now serves as a place to learn, contemplate and play around.',

    'MJS is a newly founded private initiative with the aim of creating an exemplary kindergarten and primary school that provides an inspirational and practical education to the young children in its care. It is located near Sentema, a village about 20km west of Kampala. The inspiration for the design was to create a ‘large home’ for the children that functions as a comfortable enabling educational environment. The architectural ambition is not programmatically prescriptive, but rather to inspire teachers and students alike to inhabit spaces in multiple and creative ways, to (literally) think outside the box and to treat the entire school, not just the classroom, as a greater learning environment. At Mustardseed, no two classrooms are alike and none of them are in the shape of a rectangle. Spaces are organically shaped and characterised by a warm, natural materiality accentuated by playful and inspiring colours. The thick, earthen, undulating external walls stop short of the roof allowing the flow of fresh air to cool down the spaces. Direct sunlight is filtered through the roof in selected areas filling the space with comfortable levels of natural light. Along circulation routes, colourful window shutters enclose relatively small and squarish openings. Each classroom has a dedicated outdoor learning area shaded by trees which can be accessed through a series of double doors. Across the school, furniture has been carefully designed and integrated into the program: this includes built-in benches and shelves, cubby holes, large full-height black boards and light-weight yet sturdy tables and chairs.
The landscape and architectural design are in complete harmony with each other. Free flowing forms of internal teaching spaces resonate in the landscape design in fluid, flowing lines which seek to nurture curiosity for learning within children. A holistic approach to teaching is core to the overall concept of Mustardseed which means learning from and with nature is of central importance. This objective is taken seriously in the design by literally creating a space for nature. Another ambition of this project is to improve biodiversity, despite the construction, and to (re-) create indigenous forests, whilst ensuring human activities on the land are sustainable, practical, and enrich the overall environment. These goals are being achieved through conservation agriculture, soil regeneration and sustainable indigenous timber plantations.',

    'Sustainable Rural Development Program: One University One Village',
    'The One University One Village (1U1V) Initiative was launched by Prof. Edward NG and Dr. Li WAN at The Chinese University of Hong Kong (CUHK) in 2014. It aspires to bring together the expertise, knowledge and human resources of “a university” to improve the livelihood of “a village” and its needy villagers in a strategic, systematic and sustainable manner. In 2015, 1U1V team conducted a post-earthquake reconstruction project in Yunnan, China to demonstrate the use of “high-science-low-technology” strategies with the “local materials, local labour, and local technology” principle of rural construction, and to encourage endogenous development in rural China. The project and the holistic strategy behand it creatively mended the environmental, economic, and social sustainable development of poor rural areas. Since 2017, the team started to scale up the work, and to continue the work more systematically, with the building of the Terra Centre in Kunming as the working base in China to research, promote, train and knowledge transfer. With funding support from the Chan Cheung Mun Chung Charitable Fund, 60 more village houses have been rebuilt and more than 70 houses are under construction in Southwest China. Sustainable rural development is a significant issue in China, which has more than 40% of its population living in rural areas. The development of poor rural areas in mountainous regions of Southwest China has been relatively slow and unsustainable. The crucial support that poor rural areas of China require is not only funding but also innovative ideas and systematic strategies. Rammed earth construction has a long history in China. Raw earth is the main material used in traditional architecture because it is inexpensive, accessible and exhibits remarkable thermal performance. However, under the impact of urbanization, rural residents tend to think that earthen buildings are associated to poverty and backwardness. Moreover, improving the seismic performance of earth buildings is a big challenge since many of them are located in earthquake-prone areas. To provide a suitable and sustainable solution for rural reconstruction in Southwest China, our team explores the research and innovates rammed earth building technology to provide a safe, economical, simple, and sustainable reconstruction strategy that the rural residents can afford, own, and disseminate.
To ensure systematic and sustainable rural reconstruction work with innovative ideas, scientific research is essential to understand the context, identify the problem, and find a proper solution. To empower the rural residents and encourage endogenous development, “high-science-low-technology” strategies and “local labour, local materials, and local technology” principle was applied in poor rural areas in Southwest China. Instead of promoting the benefits of imported brick and concrete, our team determined whether the shortfalls of traditional rammed earth technology and the fragility of village life could be addressed in situ. The implementation of this strategy was a simple step in rebuilding the lives of the people. Since 2014, our team has started to build rural houses to demonstrate a comprehensive and systematic construction system and resulting substantially high building quality. Meanwhile, the residents were empowered through the demonstration projects with craftsman training and co-construction. Through this long-term cooperation and learning-by-doing process, we established mutual trust with the villagers and convinced them that the innovative, anti-seismic rammed earth building was a good solution. 
Our rural programme provides an interdisciplinary, innovative and sustainable solution for poor rural areas in China. This solution has been generated by multidisciplinary partnerships and networking platforms. We also hope this knowledge database can also inspire and lead the work of the local governments and other NGOs in China and other underprivileged areas in less-developed countries, and eventually create a knowledge value chain that helps build a better future for rural communities around the world. More than 60 village houses have been rebuilt and more than 70 houses are under construction in Southwest China. More than 6 villager craftsman construction teams (including a women construction team) were established. Moreover, the innovative rammed earth building technology can be replicated for the improvement of poor rural areas where there are similar natural and social conditions to those in the poor rural areas of Southwest China, for example, in the rural regions of Nepal and India.',

    'Terra Centre',
    'Through the cooperation with Kunming University of Science and Technology (KUST), One University One Village team have improved the construction technology and seismic performance of the earth construction in Southwest rural China. In order to carry out long-term artisans training, to provide space for conducting experiments, research and practical study, and to showcase the technologies and achievements of new seismic earth construction, the 1U1V team built the Terra Centre in KUST campus with funding support from the Chan Cheung Mun Chung Charitable Fund.
The project design is highly based on the local climate condition of Kunming. Appropriate passive design strategies guaranteed low operating energy consumption. All the materials used in the wall are natural materials. No industrial stabilizers were added in the earth wall. The wall is 100% recyclable, degradable, and pollution free. 
The Terra Centre is not only a building but a research and education tool. The team trained and employed villagers to build the Terra Centre and thus transfer to them a way to make their livings economically later. The result verified an appropriated solution of the local reconstruction that provides references for national rural construction policies and earth building seismic standards. Research shows that socioeconomic value is crucial in sustainable rural development. The environmental load of vernacular houses in poor rural areas is low already. The key issue is how to improve the safety, quality and dignity of the living environment without adding substantial environmental load. Earth building has a very long history in China. Terra Center as a research centre for earthen architecture and rural sustainable development, applied “high-science and low-technology” strategy with “local materials, local labour and local technology” principle to encourage endogenous and sustainable development in poor rural areas in China.
    The building design is highly based on local climate condition so that proper passive design strategies can be selected. Kunming has a moderate climate with abundant sunshine and large temperature difference between day and night. With good thermal mass, rammed earth wall is a very suitable material. We designed a semi-outdoor space with top lighting in the middle of the building to provide a comfortable multifunctional space for multiple training and academic activities. Passive design strategies including passive solar heating, natural ventilation, and shading guaranteed high indoor environmental quality and low operating energy consumption. No active cooling and heating equipment has been used in this project.
    To minimize the impact to the local environment, 89% of the building materials (by weight) are local natural materials (raw earth, gravel, sand, and bamboo). No industrial stabilizer was added to the wall, i.e., the wall is 100% recyclable and pollution-free. The roof structure is made of bamboo that is a fast-growing material with low embodied energy. No decoration material was used on the building façade and interior walls. Industrial materials, such as cement and steel, are limited and efficiently used in key structural parts to ensure building safety and building environmental quality.
    We meet the safety needs of people by improving the building seismic performance. To improve wall strength and reduce cracks, we analyzed the basic properties of the soil and optimized the proportion by adding gravel and sand. The air compressed rammers and the aluminum alloy formwork are applied to Improving the compressive strength of the wall. In terms of structural design, reinforced concrete tie columns, ring beams, foundation and floor slabs are applied to enhance the structural integrity. The result of mechanical property tests and shaking table tests corroborates that the seismic performance of the rammed earth building significantly is improved, thereby meeting the local seismic codes perfectly.
The Terra Centre is not only a building but a research and education tool. We trained and employed villagers to build the Terra Centre and thus transfer to them a way to make their livings economically later. 33 villagers (including 5 women) joined this project and passed the craftsmen training. The project changed the attitude of the villagers towards rammed earth buildings. They became interested in switching back from their brick-concrete houses because the project protected their local traditional construction method and lifestyle. The project result provides references for national rural construction policies and earth building seismic standards.',

    '1 Lasam',
    'Taking 10 years to conceptualize, 1 Lasam is the first GBI Platinum Building in Perak. Its V-shape footprint designed to maximize the footprint, with a courtyard carved out in the centre for natural ventilation throughout. Fully built with exposed red-bricks and concrete, this green building is also entirely powered by solar panel. Lush greenery occupies breakout spaces for the worker who to enjoy views out to the nature. Double layered brick walls at the west facing facade cut down heat gain substantially.
Being the first building in the country to win PAM Awards in SDGs category, 1 Lasam has fulfilled eight category in this United Nation''s standard. It is a bold addition to Ipoh''s cityscape and contributes positively to the country''s sustainability scene. 1 Lasam was conceptualised more than eight years ago by the owner Dato Lim, when GBI rating tool was new and there was still no other green buildings in Perak. The amicable and ambitious client wanted to build the first ever GBI Platinum building in the state, to resonate with the group’s motto of being a pioneer in many of the businesses they have ventured in since decades ago.

¬ A central courtyard was carved in the centre, to allow more daylighting into the office spaces. Nako windows were installed at high levels of all office spaces for natural cross and stack ventilation through the central courtyard, so that during a cool day no air conditioning would be required. 

Measuring about 30,000sf of office space, the 5-story office block comes with majority workspaces with ancillary spaces e.g. conference room, gallery space etc.The design team explored the concept of floating boxes which further developed into box-in-box geometry. The higher floors were lifted up supported by a bold V-shape column, to allow for vehicle circulation on the street level. With the neighbouring army camp, many restrictions in building design were imposed. The west facing double layered wall installed with dense louvres not only eliminated direct view to the camp, it also blocked the heat and sunlight to the office spaces in the evening. On this gesture, the Architect managed to kill two birds with one stone.
Eight categories for United Nation’s Sustainable Development Goals were achieved. The complying categories included Responsible Consumption and Production, as relatively high percentage of construction material was used and many construction waste being recycled. Clean Water and Sanitisation also played an important role in the design of the building. While both rainwater harvesting and greywater recycling led to high reduction in portable water, storm water control was also catered for, with a bioswales constructed on site for effective water drainage.

Other green features included maximising electricity generation from the solar panels, rainwater and grey water harvesting, tinted glass, grasscrete for lowering heat island effect, and bioswales on site for effective storm water drainage etc. 

Materials were selected carefully to reflect the client’s intention to keep the building as “raw” as possible. Exposed bare concrete, red bricks applied with waterproofing solution, simple aluminium framed tinted glass, exposed ceiling throughout, and to many’s surprises, not a single drip of paint was used in the entire building. 

To resonate further the V-shape land and V-shape column, V-shape balustrades were designed to emphasise the strong alphabet presence of the client’s mother company name “BVH”.

1 Lasam was perhaps one of the boldest new addition to Ipoh’s low profile skyline. It’s head-turning architecture has attracted interests from professionals and the public in general since it’s completion. With Dato’s intention to allow public access on the ground floor for green building education, we believe this building will contribute positively to the local sustainable architecture scene in many years to come.',

Zhuguanlong Tea Leaf Market featured a multi-functional tea leaf market, aiming for a boost in tea leaf economy and better public spaces for local people..

A large-span space was proposed for various functions at different times of the year based on earlier bamboo construction experience, fundamental functions of the market and other demands by the public. Apart from seasonal tea leaf trading, the market can be used for farm product trading, villagers’ short stay and children’s sports activities. On special occasions such as weddings and funerals, people can also gather under the market’s roof for a feast. 

The project‘s structural form inspired by a sort of traditional woven arch structure built with local raw bamboo. Locally obtained natural materials and recycled building materials such as soil, wood and stone were all used for construction, motivating local craftsmen to wisely “turn wastes into treasures” with refined local building technologies, presenting a well-utilized public building to the villagers. Zhuguanlong Township of Shouning County, Ningde City of Fujian Province, is a township fertile of tea leaf yet to be lifted out of poverty at the time of the project’s planning phase. A multi-purpose large-span space was proposed as a tea market in the town. Apart from seasonal tea leaf trading, the market can be used for farm product trading, villagers’ short stay and children’s sports activities. On special occasions such as weddings, funerals and the local beggar festival, people can also gather under the market’s roof for a feast. 

The design team thoroughly studied building technologies of “rainbow bridge”, a sort of traditional wooden arch bridge achieved with ancient people’s wisdom, searching for solutions. The team found that the shelters could both be built with simple traditional building methods as the rainbow bridge with refined bamboo construction technologies. Finally, through craftsmen’s simple processing of raw bamboo, which Zhuguanlong township was richly endowed with, a woven bamboo structure with an 18-meter span was completed

The project built with locally obtained and recycled materials, which is people-centered, low-carbon and innovative. The design team thoroughly studied the possibility of recycling local materials. Field study showed that red soil on site was frequently used on local rammed-earth walls; bamboo woods prosper in mountainous lands along the site; dilapidated houses, which were being demolished at that time, could provide rubble from wall foundations and wood pieces from pillars and beams. As a result, recycled rubbles were used on newly built walls, while red soil on site was rammed into walls by local craftsmen; moso bamboo, through anti-corrosion treatment by the bamboo contractor, was assembled into large-span structures; recycled wood pieces was processed into wooden couches or wood bricks within rammed-earth walls. 

The design team also visited a stone processing factory to collect stone leftovers from processing, which were later cut into smaller pieces on both exterior and interior pavement. Those recycled materials, usually seen as wastes and thus coming at very low costs, were re-utilized by local villagers and craftsmen and extended their life in a new place, bearing our respect for people’s wisdom and labor. 

Zhuguanlong Tea Leaf Market is one project of the team’s series of sustainable practices and can be viewed as sustainable from environmental, social and economic perspectives. 
To achieve environmental sustainability, the project was built with locally obtained and recycled materials with low innate carbon footprint. Besides, it has made full use of natural ventilation, daylighting and rain-water landscapes, achieving harmony with surrounding natural lands. 

To achieve economic sustainability, the planning of the project was established under the premise of boosting local agricultural economy, enriching daily life in the community and involving local people in construction to make profits for their families. To achieve social sustainability, the market was positioned as a space of the people, by the people and for the people. Besides, through the use of local materials and refined traditional building technologies, local features were showcased throughout the building, celebrating the township’s unique culture and history.',

    'The oil mill & cannery project is a concept fully integrated into the site, from picking to bottling and labeling. It’s also an attempt to rehabilitate a fringe of territory by infusing new productive energy. An energy that creates values, jobs and well-being.
Respecting the waxworks of organic farming, the olive growing complex now allows the production of very high-quality organic olive oil following a process fully integrated into the site. It employs around 100 men and women during the production phases. Modern technologies allow the use of local resources and place sustainability at the heart of all agricultural and business activities.
Olive cultivation plays an essential role in the social and economic life of Tunisia and represents around 15% of the total value of final agricultural production. In addition, the olive sector represents the direct or indirect livelihood of more than 1 million people.
Rural Tunisian women participate very actively in the picking of olive trees; these jobs, although seasonal, provide rural families with very appreciable annual income which generally contributes to financing children''s education ...
Today, agricultural products from the Segermès estate stand out for their high quality both on the Tunisian market and internationally. Rewarded with numerous distinctions on a worldwide scale. Route & confluence: The establishment of the project emanates from a territorial position. The chosen location maintains a privileged dialogue with a water reservoir as well as a basilica from the Byzantine period. The project is part of the logic of a confluence, an emergence built by the directional multiplicity of the natural and “civilizational” components of this unique place.
A historical past: The foundations of the new building are nourished by the historical roots of the place whose Byzantine remains remain. The ground floor opens onto the landscape and overlooks the old basilica through the presence of a Forum which becomes a semi-public space for meetings and contemplation. The staging of the archaeological remains also helps to revive the historical past of the region which was previously abandoned.
The olive tree at the heart of the process: The architecture of the oil mill, resulting from the framework of the olive grove, also tells the story of the extraction process. The oil is kept in the center of the building and the volume of the silos thus constitutes a link between the two levels of the new building.',

    'IUCN-Wuzhiqiao Community-based Environmental Education Centre',
    'IUCN-Wuzhiqiao Community-based Environmental Education Centre is a public welfare project conducted by a team of university student volunteers. The project is located in a village in northern China named Xiaowopu. The village, as the water source of Beijing, is a site of the project “Mega-cities and their Watersheds: Nature-based Solutions for Sustainable Drinking Water Sources” funded by EU China. Since 2017, over 200 volunteers have worked in this village. Taking “Architecture as Social Process” as the principal idea, the project has built a series of public spaces and facilities including a school, an open-air theatre, a public square, a community kitchen, a bridge, a water-taking facility and barrier-free structures, and provided various social services, such as environmental education, clean energy promotion, medical consultation, smartphone using skill training and craftsmen training, in order to improve the living environment and social vitality of the community, and enhance its sustainable development. As a rural community development project led by architects, the principal idea of this project is "Architecture as a Social Process", which means to establish positive social relationships through public building activities. Just like throwing a stone into calm water, building, as an event, can activate the community and promote its development.

The project is located in Xiaowopu, a village in North China. In 2015, the village was included into EU China’s project “Mega-cities and their Watersheds: Nature-based Solutions for Sustainable Drinking Water Sources” as the water source of Beijing. Our team has been working in this village since 2017, and over 200 university students have served as volunteers for the village. We have built a series of public spaces and facilities, including a school, an open-air theatre, a public square, a community kitchen, a bridge, a water-taking facility and barrier-free structures. And we have also provided various social services, such as environmental education, clean energy promotion, medical consultation, smartphone using skill training and craftsmen training.

The most significant strategy of this project is to apply a series of unique modes of work, which include:

1)	Multi-participation Organization: The villagers and student volunteers, as the most important participants, always work together through the whole process of the project, including planning, design, construction and maintenance. While the village committee and NGO provide financial support and coordination. Everyone contributes, and everyone benefits. 
2)	Sneaking Time in the Busy Year: Working all year-round on the farm, the villagers only have free time for construction in slack seasons. And the students are only available during weekends and holidays. Therefore, the project is divided into different stages, which are embedded and conducted in slack seasons and holidays. In other words, the project is distributed in different periods of the year.
3)	The Interweaving of Construction and Use: Different from the linear working pattern of other building projects, this project applies a rolling pattern, interweaving the construction and use of facilities. Once a new facility is built, the benefit it brings encourages the villagers and volunteers to work harder and better on the next one. Thus, a “compound interest” mode is achieved.

What’s more, various strategies are also used in the design process, including the reordering of spaces, preservation of collective memory, emphasis of ritual space, identity shaping of water source village.

The project has brought significant benefits in three ways:

1)	First, through the provision of public space, facilities and social service, the living condition of the villagers is improved, and the public life of the community is more active.
2)	Second, through the provision of environmental education, awareness of environmental protection in the village has been enhanced.
3)	Third, through the provision of opportunities of social practice for the students, potential experts for rural development in the future are cultivated.',

The integrated design process takes a three-step approach: Step 1) The programmatic needs are developed through a collaborative engagement of listening and dialogue with the local community; Step 2) Considering its cultural context, climate, and physical characteristics, a deep understanding of the site is formed; Step 3) The program and natural systems are woven together to optimize the passive design opportunities while enhancing the celebration of the environment. 

The final design is highlighted by a holistic understanding and adaptation to the site as an integrated living system. The sculptural building massing & form expresses a strong sense of place and identity informed by indigenous knowledge. The use of sustainable and renewable materials including regional mass timber are able to efficiently sequester carbon. The spatial and experiential design improves the indoor environmental quality, health and wellbeing for its tenants, and is accessible, inclusive and welcoming to all.

Passive Systems: Some design elements that evolved from this process were envelope specific, such as R-values, window wall ratios and shape/size of windows with shading options. The use of the landscape as part of the overall environmental strategy – to moderate solar and stormwater, and to be a purifier of the ventilation air. The landscape design overflowed into a biophilic approach to the architecture with natural materials and systems, such as the solar chimney and extensive green roofs. 
	
Active Systems: The heat is delivered through in-floor – fed via heat pumps connected to the geo-exchange piling system – an integrated engineering structural and environmental strategy. Outside air volumes are doubled with no energy penalty through the use of the earth tube systems, which also provide passive cooling in conjunction with natural ventilation.

The new building adopts the "light intervention" design strategy, in which groups of small architectural groups are placed in the open space between the reserved buildings, creating a strong contrast between the old and the new, and regenerating the ruins into modern horticultural pavilions full of greenery.

Light intervention, reflected in the "light structure" - the use of prefabricated steel structure system to achieve environmental protection and rapid construction process; "Light image" - slender structural components combined with climbing vertical greening to create a light architectural image, contrasting with the roughness and thickness of industrial buildings; "Light attitude" - boundless green gardens permeate the industrial site, allowing the building to dissolve its image and disappear from nature.

From a lime-burning factory to a space that carries new life, the design and construction of the main pavilion is not to erase the past and forget history, but to leave traces and let history speak. Between the old and the new, today''s thinking and creation are also passers-by, and more reverie about beautiful cities and spaces belongs to the future.',

    'Education Center: new learning opportunities',
    'The project aims to rethink architecture as an instrument of inclusion by providing educational facilities that embrace the sensory surprises of New York, offering new learning opportunities in the heart of Manhattan. The proposed architectural interventions aim to create new configurations of spaces for interaction and socialization for schools, and especially for children growing up in a city where everything is tenfold. This new way of thinking about spaces was achieved through the use of sequences and variations that are omnipresent in New York. For the detailed development of the project, the intervention sites are located in a neighborhood in the heart of Manhattan, along 8th Avenue. Both sites offer a strong relationship to the streetscape and represent a great opportunity to provide new educational spaces for New York schools. The new principle of extracurricular spaces forms a new qualitative resilient system that uses the existing qualities of the neighborhood to build complementary spaces to the city’s schools. Through their structural design and their principle of openness to the city, the educational centers express a unique architectural identity in the urban fabric. Human interactions and acquisition of knowledge among children are enhanced by the extracurricular facilities offered, which can also be used by anyone requiring facilities such as those proposed. Schools have complementary spaces for teaching, learning, creating new opportunities for socialization, etc. New learning methods are created by the stimulation between the activity of the streetscape and the extracurricular facilities. The sequences and variations actively present in the city have made it possible to propose new ways of thinking the spatial organization of a classroom, a playground, a cafeteria, etc. The sharing of knowledge and the strong relationship with a city in constant movement are essential elements for the growth of children, allowing them to improve their ability to adapt to unexpected situations. By integrating these functions into the urban fabric of Manhattan’s neighborhoods, a resilient network takes place, optimizing the social and educational integration of children and residents of the city. In this way, the educational centers are an extension of the existing schools of New York, complementing the overcrowded neighborhoods of Manhattan. The architecture of the educational centers creates a strong relationship with the streetscape of the neighborhood and allows children to benefit from school spaces that offer new learning conditions by using the exceptional qualities of the city: sequences, variations and overload of sense. The centers add quality to children’s educational experience and provide new learning opportunities that can be seen as a new vision for New York’s future schools. It is a human-centered approach that addresses the feelings of individuals in a sensory overloaded environment. A new resilient network of schools in Manhattan offering new learning opportunities.',

    'Central Vista Redevelopment',
    'The Redevelopment of Central Vista, New Delhi, is a historically and culturally significant project proposing the redevelopment over 440 Hectares of prime land. Reimagining New Delhi as a Garden City, the redevelopment proposal offers a possibility of bestowing it with an international iconic stature and creating a state-of-the-art futuristic and livable vision of urban development. The Redevelopment of Central Vista, New Delhi, is a historically and culturally significant project proposing the redevelopment over 440 Hectares of prime land.

Urban Context
Located in the heart of New Delhi, the capital of India, the design concepts are centred on restoration, adaptive re-use, intelligent conservation, upgradation, retrofitting and reconfiguration of the existing edifices to preserve the celebrated historic value of the area, along with creation of some landmark edifices. The site comprises of highly coveted buildings such as the Presidential Residence (Rashtrapati Bhawan), the North and South Blocks, the Indian Parliament, Ministerial Complexes, various Secretariat buildings besides the National Archives, few National Museums and a National Stadium.

Master Planning Concept
The overall master planning integrates elements of harmony, balance and rhythm to ideate a concept which is a comprehensive understanding of the challenges of the present times while leaving ample area for unhindered future expansion. The axis of the Vista extends more than 2 kms in length and is developed as a mixed-use cultural district. A natural stream balances the overall site and is flanked by extensively landscaped avenues and pedestrian spine on either side. By restricting vehicular movement on the outer roads, this street is kept pedestrian-friendly, becoming an eco-conscious zone. The design also proposes a monorail concealed under the terraced landscape which links all buildings in the precinct & integrates with city mass transit significantly reducing vehicles in this district. Technological advancement is utilised to its fullest with features such as high-end security systems, display screens to help guide pedestrians with movement in and around the site, well-regulated parking for vehicles etc.

Vernacular design
The architectural design strives for a responsible concept development through an understanding of conservation, sustainability and holistic approach. The offices are proposed as mixed-use spaces and inspired by the mohallas, chowks and bazaars of Chandni Chowk (one of the oldest area in New Delhi), accommodate retail areas, restaurants, lounging spaces etc. in their central courtyards. Entrance of these buildings use Gopurams and Toranas as inspiration, giving an abstract and magnificent look to the whole Complex. 

Climatologically responsive Design 
The offices would be able to symbolically represent India through use of jaalis, louvres, accommodating semi-shaded central courtyards and creation of double skin façade by extending slabs (chhajjas) supported by colonnaded corridors around the Secretariat edifices. These architectural elements and techniques work well in the Indian landscape and establish a climatologically responsive design. Stone panels with different traditional Indian architectural motifs become the patterns for jaalis which celebrate art and architectural history of India while synchronising with the existing Lutyens’ character. 

Re-defining urban character
The proposal also integrates high-level technology through automation and artificial intelligence systems in the buildings for increased security. North and South Blocks, already existing and highly prominent offices, are proposed to be restored instead of using them as museums. At one end of the axis, a precinct of Museums has been created around India Gate, a national memorial monument, which proposes adaptive reuse of historical Indian princely estates. 

Reimagining New Delhi as a Garden City, the redevelopment proposal offers a possibility of bestowing it with an international iconic stature and creating a state-of-the-art futuristic and livable vision of urban development.

    'Helio Hut',
    'Helio Hut is an urban canopy for the experience of thermal delight. Located in Logroño’s Parque Felipe VI, the design is based on the idea that architectural environments can arouse in the public a desire for comfort and pleasure, exploration and participation. Conceived as a device for sun-filtering, the roof system modulates the relationship between natural daylight, direct heat gain, solar radiation, and thermal comfort. The roof geometries allow the warm morning sun to transmit through the canopy while blocking the hot afternoon sun, creating a series of microclimates under the roof with mediated levels of comfort throughout the day. Its ever-changing pattern of shadows gives another layer of tactility to the space. The goal is to experiment with the potential of using the environment’s thermal comfort as a tool to invite public participation and exploration, creating a direct, tangible, and experiential connection between the human body and the urban environment.

Learning from local crafting techniques, the weaving angles of the esparto structure are mediated so that each segment of the woven structures can respond to specific sun angles. The woven materials are dyed with different colors to modulate heat absorption, make visible the radiation intensity, and enhance the vibrancy of the park. PUBLIC SPACE + THERMAL DELIGHT
The design of Helio Hut is based on the idea that architectural environments can arouse in the public a desire for comfort and delight, exploration and participation. As an urban canopy to reclaim under-used public space, Helio Hut foregrounds its environment to create a site-specific collective place within the open landscape of Logroño’s Parque Felipe VI, making tangible the movement of the sun and its thermal impact on our public space in Logroño. 


HUMAN BODIES + URBAN ENVIRONMENT
The structure is a public device for sun-filtering - modulating the relationship between natural daylight, direct heat gain, solar radiation, and thermal comfort. The idea is to allow the warm morning sun to transmit through the roof while blocking the hot afternoon sun, creating a series of microclimates under the roof with mediated levels of comfort throughout the day. Its ever-changing pattern of shadows gives another layer of tactility to the space. The goal is to experiment with the potential of using the environment’s thermal comfort as a tool to invite public participation and exploration, creating a direct, tangible, and experiential connection between the human body and the urban environment.


TRADITION + TECHNOLOGY 
Helio Hut''s hovering canopy is formed from an aggregation of identical geometric modules. Using low-carbon plywood panels, the cantilever modules surrounding the central pillar utilize standardized, prefabricated plywood components, each comprises of a main frame structure with a superstructure slotted on top. Learning from the esparto weaving tradition in Spain, we create a series of esparto structures inserted into the roof frames, providing mediated thermal comfort for the users below. The goal is to experiment with the potential of fusing traditional crafts with contemporary fabrication and simulation technologies and to discover new material possibilities for public space making.


SENSATION + PARTICIPATION
The weaving angles of the esparto structure are mediated through solar analysis to modulate direct heat gain and radiation. Each segment of the woven structures will be dyed with different colors to modulate heat absorption, make visible the radiation intensity, and add visual vibrancy to the park. The vibrant color and shadow patterns will create new sensations for the public visiting the pavilion at different times of the day.',

    'Hanzhong Road Metro Station',
    'Hanzhong Road Station, located in Jing''an District, Shanghai, China, is the interchange station of Shanghai Metro Line 1, Line 12 and Line 13, put into use on April 10, 1995 with the opening of Line 1; Passed Line 12 and Line 13 on December 19, 2015. In the 1990s, there were large areas of low-rise residential buildings and little high-rise apartments and office buildings near Hanzhong Road Station. Along with the construction of the subway, the old residential buildings were gradually replaced by high-rise commercial complexes, office buildings and new residential communities.
Circumstance:Hanzhong Road Station is a five-story island-platform. For the platforms of Line 12 and 13 are arranged upward-and-downward counterpoint, there is no need to transfer through the station hall; The station hall of Line 12 and 13 connects to the hall of Line 1 through an underground passage. As an interchange station, the station has multiple floors with high pedestrian flow during peak hours, but clear flow lines ensure its traffic efficiency.  
The station has ten entrances distributed in three street blocks. Entrance 1-4 are located above the station hall of Line 1 and Entrance 5-10 above the station hall of Lines 12 and 13. Entrance 5 and 10 lead to underground commercial space and the accessible elevator is located near Entrance 10. The entrances lead to five roads. Among them, Hengfeng Road and Hengtong Road are traffic arteries. 
Buildings around the station are mainly high-rise commercial and office buildings. Residential areas are further on the north and southeast sides. The station hall area of Line 12 and 13 is now covered by a Shopping Center whose underground part is directly connected with the station.   
The station is relatively close to Suzhou River and adjacent to Hengfeng Road Bridge on the west side. Entrances 3, 7, 8, and 9 are only one block from the Suzhou River along which is waterfront landscape green space.
Questions and Optimization:Entrance 1-4 are located above the hall of Line 1. Due to its early construction period, the vertical transportation facilities are crude. Heat map shows the north side (commercial-office area) of Hanzhong Road Station has a higher pedestrian flow compared to the south side (residential area). Entrance 1 in this area has a dense flow of people during rush hours with a narrow stairs and no two-way escalator; The barrier-free elevator near entrance 10 is hidden behind the street greening whose accessibility and visibility need improving.
Passengers entering and exiting the station are mainly office staff and residents nearby with a high demand for small restaurants, fresh food, convenience stores, etc. However, except for entrance 5 and 10 leading to the shopping mall. There is only one bakery next to entrance 1 and no small commercial service facilities near the other entrances. A temporary building near Suzhou River at Entrance 2 and 3 currently serve as a food market, indicating a lack of community oriented commercial support. 
The station is near Suzhou River. However, along Hengfeng Road and Meiyuan Road which connect the station and landscape area are warehouses and parking lots. Sight is squeezed by Hengfeng Road Bridge, lacking direct visual connection and prompts. The pedestrian experience can be optimized by renovating local streets, connecting subway stations with landscape spaces.',

    'Bagaan, a vertical community farming',
    'Vertical farming in urban areas can be a great solution for both senior citizens and job-seeking young people.

For senior citizens, vertical farming can provide them with a new and exciting hobby that can keep them active and engaged in their community. It can also provide them with a source of fresh, healthy produce, which is particularly important for older individuals who may have limited mobility or access to transportation.

For job-seeking young people, vertical farming can offer a range of opportunities. They can work in urban farms as growers, caretakers, or even in marketing and sales. As urban farming continues to grow in popularity, there will be more job opportunities for people with a range of skills and interests.

In addition to job opportunities, vertical farming can also offer young people the chance to learn about sustainable agriculture and urban food systems. They can gain valuable experience and knowledge that they can use to pursue careers in related fields or even start their own businesses.

Overall, vertical farming has the potential to benefit both senior citizens and job-seeking young people in urban areas. It can provide fresh produce, employment opportunities, and a sense of community and purpose. With the climate change, Bangladesh, a deltaic plain, is expected to experience frequent flooding and other ecological hazards which can lead to extensive pressure in agricultural production and biodiversity. As a result, the food security will be at risk. This paper discusses in details the elements related to farming such as land, water, pesticides, seeds, food supply, food safety, etc. and its impacts on those components in Bangladesh. As for instance, it is discussed how agriculture promotes the land loss and an estimated total area of the tropical forest in Bangladesh was reduced to 900 km2 in 2019, from 966 km2 in 2001. Also, a discussion takes place regarding the food supply and the idea of food miles is briefly mentioned and how it is impacting the supply of food and is adding to the woes of the farmers in Bangladesh, particularly in light of pandemics like Covid-19.

The paper further discusses the potential of multi-disciplinary intervention, including architecture, to address the concerns related to agriculture and climate change. The concept of vertical farming from an architectural point-of-view is discussed in this paper. Case studies from the projects of renowned architects like Dr. Ken Yeang are studied to fully the principles of this kind of farming along with studies of successful implementations from countries like Japan, South Korea, Netherlands etc. 

Lastly, the paper introduces the project Bagaan- a new visionary model for the climate adaptation of off-grid, integrated and resilient urban farming that can power and feed self-reliant families around a neighborhood. The proposed project is expected to reduce carbon emission and also the land use by 98% and grow the percentage of 100% organic while creating job opportunities and self-reliance within a community, mostly amongst the elderly adults. The paper shows a positive correlation in the ageing population getting involved in farming and green works. Hence, the target group of Bagaan is mostly the elderly citizens, who will be comprising of bigger portion of the demography of Bangladesh by the year 2050. Bagaan aims to explore the production of diverse range of agricultural products within a climatically controlled containers, with provision of machine learning technologies with easy-to-use UXP (user experience) platform, while reducing the food mile mentioned before, but the enhancing the quality of food. The paper also briefly mentions how Bagaan satisfies the Sustainable Development Goals 2030, by directly sufficing the Goal-1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, and 13.',

The structure has a large surface in contact with the open space and the upper part, always out of water, is controlled by systems that can guarantee the maximum supply of vital elements (light and water), useful for the residential/productive metabolism of the colony. FLOLONY conceives a housing unit in a marine environment, where a community of individuals chooses to live a short or long part of their lives on the open sea. As for the essential services for life the unit is autonomous and, according to its potential configurations and equipments, it can be independent (therefore with no need of external supplies) for periods varying from a few months to several years. Moving along marine routes within the temperate/equatorial zones and following the direction of the main streams, the colony maintains its energy balance using Ocean Thermal Energy Conversion – OTEC, sun energy, wave power and the methods of collection and use of high temperature waters originating from deep thermal sources.
FLOLONY is a structure made of double and triple steel layers and aluminum. Its changeable buoyancy is regulated by compensation basins that permit a float-on/float-off range of about 120ft (36.5m). This allows it to face extreme marine conditions and, in the same way, to keep its buoyancy on the surface level when there are optimum marine conditions.
The unit is divided into 19 main decks and 10 secondary (or partial) decks, for a total amount of 29 levels. In the immersed section, besides the compensation basins, there are fish farming basins, habitats for farming products, systems for the collection and treatment of precipitations, a desalination plant, storages of  potable water and fuel, emergency diesel/electric engine-generators, an electric propulsive system, a stock area for the converters of wave power, technical special areas, etc.
Accommodation units, cultural and entertaining spaces, schools, scientific and medical laboratories, pilot house areas, bridges, technical and navigation instruments, mechanical plants for air change/treatment, production workshops and laboratories, green areas, play and sport areas, etc. are situated in the changeable buoyancy section and in the emerging section.

    'Reviving AL-Nazlah',
    'Reviving the Al-Nazlah area in Fayoum aims to create a pilot project in contexts of specificity. The valuable district incubates pottery workshops which have been producing special pots used for construction since Ancient Egyptian Civilization. Thus, the upgraded construction technique which enhanced the bonding material gluing the pots together via the help of lab experiments maintained the traditional technique. Also, new forms have been introduced for the roofing construction, which enabled the local community to explore a wider range of spans through introducing domes & vaults constructed by pots. The project was initiated by Arch. El-Setouhy with an aim to indulge the local community in a participatory process which enables the locals to learn, appreciate, create and govern their cultural product. Thus, enabling them to achieve the three pillars of sustainability for the project, social, economic and environmental sustenance.  The project has been awarded the second prize of the Baku Award in 2019, Category A, with the support of UIA for creating a sustainable environmental development nucleus that has many positive impacts on the whole region. The project was nominated to receive the Aga-Khan Award cycle 2022. Also, shortlisted in the Arab Association Award for the last cycle 2022. Concept: Develop the Nazlah area by reviving its cultural heritage and returning it to become a cultural product again that the local people can be proud of it. 
Goals:
Pilot project, give a model about improving performance and maximize benefits for areas which has different kinds of arts of their local culture over hundreds of years, that Egypt has many of it. 
Create a sustain environmental development nucleus that has many positive impacts on the whole region.
Reviving the traditional crafts that characterize the region, to protect it from extinction.
Seeking to restore the place to its former value that brought happiness to the local people, while restoring confidence in their cultural heritage.

The interlocking of the pots forms a continuous arch, which creates a load-bearing mechanism. The variations and repetition of the load-bearing elements create a variety of spaces and roof treatments. The climatic sustainability stems from the zero-waste process adopted in the construction technique. The Visitor witness a powerful environmentally friendly climatic nature in terms of adequacy of internal temperatures and also as to its coherence with the surrounding nature. The geometrical iterations in the construction of the roof, which created diffused sunlight radiations on the building added an important layer in the lower temperatures inside the buildings.  This manipulation of the roof results in less heat transfer into the internal spaces than the conventional R.C. and mud bricks construction modes. The project created a process of discovery of a heritage asset, the capitalization of the architect through a participatory methodology of a familiar practice of construction that was about to go extinct, in a contemporary mode which explores architectural aesthetical values and adventurous journeys in the spatial experiences of the Visitor center. 
Program:
-Visitor center:
Introduces the historical value of this site, which facilitates marketing issue.
Contains a number of halls. The first, displays samples and information on the various pottery products produced by the people of the region, attached to it is a hall on the tools they use in making pottery, next to a hall documenting artwork (movies and songs) that were filmed in the region.
Attached to the visitor center is a space used to sit and enjoy the beautiful scenery of the waterway.
-An exhibition for displaying and selling pottery products, consisting of three rooms attached to an open space next to the current pergola to be an extension of the products display.
-Development of workshops:
The development of new workshops that were built soon, of white limestone blocks, which are not commensurate with the nature of the place and its cultural heritage.
-Services – Landscape:
Provide a multipurpose space for different cultural and related activities.
Facilitate a secured passing way for visitors that do not interrupt that of workers.
The project is closely linked to the SDGs, and sought to achieve a set of its goals, whether in the stages of implementation or after implementation, especially the goals numbers (1-3-7-13)',

Challenge
After the COVID-19 pandemic, people are eager to venture outside and rebuild their public social relationships. During China''s rapid urbanization process, a large number of urban spaces were left without detailed design and planning, with some even located in important areas for communities and natural environments. By repurposing these areas, we can activate them and create vibrant community spaces. In the era of mobile internet represented by platforms like TikTok, these "small yet refined" urban living rooms will become important face-to-face socializing venues.
Contribution
The project is about a suburb area renovation in a mountainous college town in Zhuhai, Guangzhou, China. In the north of Fenghuang Mountain, the project is located on the Y104 country road, where two abandoned unfinished buildings had existed for decades. The surrounding environment was quite negative as well: A flood discharge channel on the northwest side of the site was blocked by weeds and silt, which posed a great safety hazard. The surrounding vegetation was lush, the trees were dominated by poinciana, forming a characteristic vegetation landscape. The project renovated the buildings as well as activated the whole site, and eventually succeeded in making the whole abandoned area into an activate public place.
The renovation work was carried out on the basis of respect for the existing elements. The structures of the two unfinished buildings were preserved. The building on the east side was originally designed to have four stories. After evaluating the view of the landscape along the lake side, we persuaded the owner to rebuild the building of two stories or lower, so that it could fit nicely along with the landscape of the valley with a humble gesture.
As for the landscape design, the features of the site have been largely retained. Specifically, vegetation and trees have been preserved to form landscape nodes. Meanwhile, safety risks were resolved. Taking into account that Zhuhai is often affected by typhoons in the summer, we dredged the originally blocked discharge channel in the process of lakeshore reconstruction. Also, a few landscapes walls were set aside inclined trees to prevent them from collapsing in the wind.
After the renovation, the landscape along the lake has once again opened. The revetment was reconstructed with gravel driveway, which often used by locals. All this has created a pleasant hydrophilic space. The outdoor area is particularly vibrant. Activities such as gatherings, photography, outdoor sports are taking place daily. Residents and college students spend their leisure time here meeting friends, chatting, and relaxing. In the study room lectures and salons are held occasionally. The roof platforms are used for rehearsals and BBQs. New memories and stories on the neighborhood are taking place.',
